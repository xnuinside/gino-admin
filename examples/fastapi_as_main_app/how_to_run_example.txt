For example, your application use Fast API as a main Framework, but you use Gino as ORM
and PostgreSQL as DB and you need Admin panel for maintenance data in DB.

So all that you need to do it is just add 'if' in step where you define 'db'.

Check src/db.py

But pay attention, that you need to run admin panel and main app in different venvs or docker containers because other way variable

Gino-Admin is up and run as separate web application, so it does not matter on that writen your main App



All steps please do inside virtualenv.

Be aware:

    if you run before some other examples - remove 'data/' folder before run postgres, to clean up DB that was created for previous example

First of all run instance of PostgreSQL - use for this docker-compose.yml (from base 'examples/' folder:

    docker-compose up --build postgres

Do:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After in new window run example/src/app.py:

    python src/db.py  # to init DB

To run main Fast API application (to check that all okay):

    uvicorn main:app --port 5050

Check it on n http://0.0.0.0:5050/users/

To run Gino Admin Panel:

    python src/admin.py

It will run admin panel on http://0.0.0.0:5000/admin/


Use password and login to enter admin panel:

    login: admin
    password: 1234
